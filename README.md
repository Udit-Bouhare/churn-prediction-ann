## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is a classification problem where the goal is to identify customers who are likely to stop using a company's services.

In this project, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained on customer banking data to predict whether a customer will churn or stay.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Given customer information such as:

- Credit Score
- Geography
- Gender
- Age
- Tenure
- Balance
- Number of Products
- Credit Card Status
- Active Membership
- Estimated Salary

Predict:

- **0 → Customer Stays**
- **1 → Customer Churns**

## 📂 Dataset

Dataset contains banking customer information and churn labels.

Target Variable:

```text
Exited
```

- 1 = Customer Churned
- 0 = Customer Retained

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing

### 1. Label Encoding

Gender column:

```text
Female → 0
Male → 1
```

### 2. One-Hot Encoding

Geography column:

```text
France
Germany
Spain
```

Converted into:

```text
Geography_France
Geography_Germany
Geography_Spain
```

### 3. Feature Scaling

StandardScaler was used to normalize numerical features before training.

## 💾 Model Saving

Model weights were saved using PyTorch:

```python
torch.save({
    "model_state": model.state_dict(),
    "num_features": 12
}, "model.pth")
```

Preprocessing objects were saved using Pickle:

```python
pickle.dump(scaler, file)
pickle.dump(label_encoder_gender, file)
pickle.dump(onehot_encoder_geo, file)
```

## 🌐 Streamlit Application

The deployed application allows users to:

- Enter customer information
- Process inputs automatically
- Generate churn probability
- Display prediction results

Example Output:

```text
Churn Probability: 0.78

⚠️ Customer is likely to churn
```
